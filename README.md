Mate is a small collection that extends JavaScript and CoffeeScript,
especially on `Array`.

    require("mate");

I already compiled all files to "mate.js". You can also compile on your own. To compile,
you need "coffee-script" package installed globally, then go to this directory, then type:

    coffee --bare --join mate.js --compile .
